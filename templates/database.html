    <h3>Analysis:</h3>
    <p>
      The first thing we do is check the distribution of our target variable and from what we can see is skewed to the right, we will have to use the logarithmic function to mitigate its skewness.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this we have to check the correlation that the variables have with each other and even more important is to check what is the correlation that it has with the target variable, since here it will depend on which will be the most important variables to add to the model.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the previously analysis made the following database is being read from MongoDB:
    </p>
    <table class="roundedCorners table">
      <tr>
        <th>LotArea</th>
        <th>OverallQual</th>
        <th>OverallCond</th>
        <th>YearBuilt</th>
        <th>YearRemodAdd</th>
      </tr>
 
      {% for datas in data %}
      <tr>
        <td>{{ datas['LotArea']}}</td>
        <td>{{ datas['OverallQual']}}</td>
        <td>{{ datas['OverallCond']}}</td>
        <td>{{ datas['YearBuilt']}}</td>
        <td>{{ datas['YearRemodAdd']}}</td>
      </tr>
      {% endfor %}
    </table>
